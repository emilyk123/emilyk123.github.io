### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2, was a favorite because it was interesting that you could write into a file using code. I wrote a program that asks the user to write a message that the program will put into a file. I learned how to check if the program can open a file and how to use getline() so you can get the line that the user wrote and then print that out.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2, was another favorite because I learned how to use 2D arrays better. I used a 2D vector with a vector of California counties. Inside that vector there were vectors that had the size of the population of those counties. I learned that .at() locates the row, and .at().at() locates the column.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1, was another favorite because I was interested in learning about constructors and classes in C++. I was able to write code that reads from a CSV file and find out which state is the densest and sparsest. I learned how to write constructors using the variables from the .h file.
